                  <p class="description">The BalanceIt is a project to design a game for Sifteo cubes. This game requires users to manipulate physical cubes to finish tasks. We focused on how to utilize a prototyping method during the design process with physical limitations. For early stages, we used sketches and low fidelity paper prototypes to explore possible ideas. High fidelity prototypes were used at later stages to examine user flows in details. To ameliorate our design, we conducted user testing with users to find out issues so that we could revise this game into smoother processes.</p>

                  <p class="description">Most people read articles from the Internet. Since the number of articles are increasing rapidly, retrieving an article might become more difficult without proper cues. People tend to classify article in a computer folder system. However, as the mobile device market grows, the mobile device usage grows. In the STAR project, we investigated different cues when people retrieve articles that they read. Based on our research, we aimed to develop an application to assist users to finish these retrieving tasks efficiently.</p>
